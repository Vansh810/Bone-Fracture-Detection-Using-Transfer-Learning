# Bone-Fracture-Detection-Using-Transfer-Learning
This repository contains a deep learning pipeline for classifying fractures in medical X-ray images using a pretrained Xception model. The code is modular and designed for ease of customization and experimentation.

## Features

* **Pretrained Model:** Uses Xception with transfer learning for feature extraction.
* **Data Augmentation:** Includes rotation, shifting, and flipping to improve generalization.
* **Metrics:** Tracks Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC for comprehensive evaluation.
* **Modularity:** Clean, modular structure for easy reuse and extension.
